// Question
// What are the x- and y-coordinates of the Points referred to as p1, p2, and p3 after the following code executes? 
// Give your answer as an x-y pair such as (0, 0).

Point p1 = new Point(17, 9);
Point p2 = new Point(4, -1);
Point p3 = p2;
}
//p1.translate(3, 1);
//p2.x = 50;
//p3.translate(-4, 5);

//p1(17,9)--> p1(20,10)
//p2(4,-1)--> p2(46, 4)
//p3(46,4)--> p3(46, 4)
